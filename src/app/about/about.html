  <h1>About Scroggle</h1>
  <h3>
    <p>Scroggle is, and always has been free.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Free as in beer.  üçª</p>
    <br/>
    <p>And now, Free as in speech.  üó£</p>
    <br/>
  </h3>
  <h1>Why free?</h1>
  <h3>
    There are a ton of reasons to make it free as in beer:
    <ul>
      <li>There are too many games in the app stores riddled with ads (this drives me nuts)</li>
      <li>There are too many games in the app store that are paid or subscribe</li>
      <li>I am an individual, not a company, I don't have a marketing budget</li>
      <li>I do this for fun, because I like to play the game and I want you to like it too.</li>
    </ul>
    There are a ton of reason to make it free as in speech:
    <ul>
      <li>I can recruit other developers to lend a hand</li>
      <li>I can ask other developers to review areas of the code without an NDA</li>
      <li>I can teach other developers who want to make their own games</li>
      <li>I may get unsolicited critical feedback about how I've built the app</li>
    </ul>
