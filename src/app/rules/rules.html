    <h3>-or-</h3>
    <h3>click the (adjacent) letters you want to use to make a word (terminate the word by clicking the final letter a second time).</h3>

      <li><h3>If the selection path becomes a red color, then the word is not in the game dictionary.</h3></li>
      <li><h3>If the selection path becomes a yellow color, then you have already guessed that (valid) word</h3></li>
